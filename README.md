# Go-Bencode

A standard Go interface to bencode, there are basically six fuctions:
  * Marshal
  * Unmarshal
  * NewEncoder
  * NewEncoder.Encode
  * NewDecoder
  * Decoder.Decode

The other bencode package is https://github.com/zeebo/bencode,
as of 2013-12-03 this package is slightly faster but perhaps less 
thoroughly tested.
